## Bootstrap with react

```bash
npm i bootstrap
```

Add this code to work with bootstrap into index.js

```js
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css'
import "bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle";
```

### Notes
- Dont forget to replace all class with className
- Add `import {useState} from 'react'` before using useState
- When write javascript in html, I mean JSX :scream:, dont forget use `{ }`
- A big note is coming... Be sure that use `import... export...` things lol
