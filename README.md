# UpSchool React Lessons

After each lesson, I tried what we did/learn in the lesson. In the future, I can back to reading my notes. Then, laugh to myself. I probably say to myself, when I started to learn to react I had lots of difficulties, but now I can understand the evil JSX, hooks and etc.:smiling_imp: ( I hope I can say that 	:crossed_fingers:)
